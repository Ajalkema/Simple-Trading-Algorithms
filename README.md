### Introduction
In this project I explore a data set from Yahoo stock prices. I try to prove that stock prices are random and cannot be used to predict future stock prices.

### Install
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* pandas_datareader
* statsmodels
* yellowbrick

You also need to have software installed to run an iPython Notebook

### File Descriptions
