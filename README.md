# Trading-Algorithm

### Introduction
In this project I explore a data set from Yahoo stock prices. I try to prove that stock prices are random and cannot be used to predict future stock prices.
I find that stock price behaviour seems random and cannot be used to profit more than would be realized with a simple buy and hold strategy.

### Blog post
I wrote a blog about this project which can be found here:
